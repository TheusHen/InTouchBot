InTouchBot is a lightweight assistant built to integrate seamlessly with [my portfolio](https://theushen.me). It helps users find what they need quickly ‚Äî from contact methods to featured projects ‚Äî all in one place.

## üîç Features

- üîó Quick access to contact information (email, GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.)
- üìÅ Retrieve and showcase personal projects
- üìå Get key portfolio highlights
- üì¨ Supports smart queries like:
    - "How can I contact TheusHen?"
    - "Show me his latest project"
    - "Where can I find the blog?"

## üöÄ Usage

Embed or run the bot on your site or app. It can be used via:
- Custom Web UI (already live on [intouchbot.theushen.me](https://intouchbot.theushen.me))
- API integration (coming soon)

Note: InTouchBot can be integrated into any project, but the other project needs to provide the profile. If the request is not from `theushen.me`, the profile must be provided; otherwise, the profile will be empty.
